3. Save both files to the `public/` folder in your project
4. The files should be named:
   - `icon-192.png`
   - `icon-512.png`

### Option 2: Use Your Own Icons

1. Create two PNG images:
   - **192x192 pixels** (for Android)
   - **512x512 pixels** (for high-res displays)
2. Name them `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
3. Save to the `public/` folder
4. Recommended: Use your logo or brand colors

## Testing PWA Features Locally

### Test on Your Phone (Same WiFi)

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Find your computer's local IP:**
   ```powershell
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.5`)

3. **Open on your phone:**
   ```
   http://192.168.1.5:3000
   ```

4. **Test the features** - all responsive UI should work perfectly

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** PWA features (Add to Home Screen, offline mode) only work on HTTPS. So you'll need to deploy to Firebase to test those.

## After Deployment

Once deployed to Firebase Hosting (which provides HTTPS):

1. **Your app URL**: `https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.web.app`
2. **Open on mobile** browser
3. **Install to home screen** using instructions above
4. **Launch from home screen** - it will open in full-screen mode!

## PWA Features

### ‚úÖ What Works After Installation:

- **Standalone Mode** - No browser address bar
- **Custom Icon** - Your branded icon on home screen
- **Custom Splash Screen** - Shows icon when launching
- **Portrait Lock** - Always stays in portrait mode
- **Orange Theme** - Status bar matches your app color (#ea580c)
- **Offline Loading** - Basic offline support via service worker

### üìã Navigation & UI:

- **Bottom Tab Bar** - Easy thumb access
- **Large Touch Targets** - Buttons sized for fingers
- **Responsive Layout** - Optimized for small screens
- **Scrollable Forms** - All content accessible
- **No Zoom** - Properly sized for mobile (no pinch-to-zoom needed)

## Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" Not Showing

**On Android:**
- Make sure you're using **HTTPS** (deploy to Firebase first)
- Open in **Chrome** or **Edge** (not Firefox)
- The manifest must be valid (already configured)

**On iPhone:**
- Must use **Safari** browser (not Chrome)
- Look in Share menu, not browser menu
- iOS doesn't show automatic prompts, always manual

### Icons Not Showing

- Make sure `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` are in `public/` folder
- Rebuild and redeploy: `npm run deploy`
- Clear cache and reinstall the app

### App Not Working Offline

- Service worker only activates on **second visit**
- First visit loads everything, second visit enables offline
- Some features need internet (Firebase data)

## Customization

### Change App Name

Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Full App Name",
  "short_name": "Short Name",
  ...
}
```

### Change Theme Color

Edit `public/manifest.json` and `index.html`:
```json
"theme_color": "#ea580c"  // Your color
```

### Change Orientation

Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
"orientation": "portrait"  // or "any" for auto-rotate
```

## Best Practices for Mobile Users

1. **Always deploy latest version** before distributing to staff
2. **Test on actual devices** - iOS and Android behave differently
3. **Keep icons high quality** - they scale on different devices
4. **Monitor network usage** - Firebase can consume data
5. **Train staff** on installation process

## Distribution to Staff

### Method 1: QR Code

1. Generate QR code for your app URL: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/
2. Print or share the QR code
3. Staff scan with camera app ‚Üí opens in browser ‚Üí install

### Method 2: Direct Link

1. Share the Firebase URL via WhatsApp/SMS
2. Staff open link ‚Üí follow installation instructions above

### Method 3: In-Person Setup

1. Have staff bring their phones
2. Open the URL in their browser
3. Guide them through "Add to Home Screen"
4. Create their login credentials

## Security on Mobile

- ‚úÖ All data transmitted over **HTTPS**
- ‚úÖ Firebase Authentication secures user accounts
- ‚úÖ Session persists after installation
- ‚úÖ Logout button in top-right corner
- ‚úÖ Staff can only access their assigned store

## Updates

When you update the app:

1. **Build and deploy**: `npm run deploy`
2. **Staff devices** will auto-update on next visit
3. **May need to close and reopen** the app
4. **Service worker** updates automatically

## Performance Tips

- First load may be slow (downloading resources)
- Subsequent loads are much faster (cached)
- Images and icons are cached for offline use
- Firebase data still requires internet

## Support

If staff have issues:
1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Try closing and reopening** the app
3. **Reinstall**: Remove from home screen, add again
4. **Clear browser cache** if persistent issues
